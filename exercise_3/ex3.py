#STUDY DRILLS
#SD-1: Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself explaining what the line does.
#Done

#SD-2: Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python3.6? Start python3.6 this way again and, using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.
#Done

#SD-3: Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
#Refer to ex3_drill.py

#SD-4: Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so itâ€™s more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
#Done, in line 6. Line 4 and 11 already a floating point

#This is printing command, "To start something big, try from small things first"

#STUDY DRILLS
#SD-1: Make your script print another line.
print ("There is first time for everything")

#SD-2: Make your script print only one of the lines.
print ("Hello World")
#print ("Hello Again")
#print ("I like typing this.")
#print ("This is fun.")
#print ('Yay! Printing.')
#print ("I'd much rather you 'not'.")
#print ('I "said" do not touch this.')
#So i use the (#) symbol to make my script only print one of the lines

#SD-3: Put a # (octothorpe) character at the beginning of a line. What did it do? Try to find out what this character does
# Octothorpe symbol is used to tell the python to ignore all script after that symbol. It can be handy to make some comment or make a notice about the coding processes
